                <h2 id="cardtitle">BACKGROUND</h2>
                <p>Flock Freight is a logistics company that seeks to transform the freight industry by encouraging
                    shared truckloads, which lower cost and carbon discharge. Acting as middleman, the firm helps
                    customers connect with shipping companies and accepts the suitable offer. The task seems
                    straightforward, but if the firm takes too long to decide, truckers can turn their eyes to a
                    different logistics company. It is challenging to choose the best rate among multiple offers under
                    such time constraints, so Flock Freight develop machine learning models that identifies the optimal
                    offer as soon as the offer is made.</p>
                <p>When considering the optimal stopping problem, the secretary approach is often discussed and might
                    resemble the issue Flock Freight faces. However, when applied to Flock Freight’s situation, the
                    performance is not satisfactory because the firm does not know how many offers an order will be
                    receiving. Thus, an algorithm as complex as Flock Freight’s problem needs to be developed.</p>

                <h2 id="cardtitle">DATA</h2>
                <p>Flock Freight has a rich amount of data on both the orders customers place and offers carriers make.
                    The order data includes a wide array of features including the origin, destination, length, and
                    pickup deadline of the item being shipped. The offer data includes the carrier ID, cost to deliver
                    item, and whether Flock Freight accepted the offer.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h2 id="cardtitle">METHODS</h2>
                <p>Four models were created: a classification model to determine whether an order will be shipped FTL or
                    PTL; two regression models to predict FTL/PTL offer rates; a regression model to predict the number
                    of offers an order will receive.</p>

                <p>Overall, we are aiming to build a combined model for all four models to decide when to stop the
                    auction and accept the offer from truck drivers for customers in order to maximize the profit. When
                    we get an order from a customer, we check how many offers we would have first. After that, we will
                    only check the predicted number of offers during the auction. And then we focus on this formula,
                    P(pool) * E(cost to fulfill pooled) + (1-P(pool)) * E(cost to fulfill unpooled).</p>

                <p>Based on the formula above, we try to predict the rate of an offer so that we can decide whether the
                    offer is valid to accept or not. If the cost of the offer is less than the result of the above
                    formula, then we accept the offer right away rather than waiting until we get the expected number of
                    offers. Otherwise, the model accepts the last offer of the expected number of offers.</p>

                <p>While building Decision Tree model, we first saw that it overfitted data easily. To not overfitting,
                    we decided to see feature correlation and apply Grid Search method. First, used feature_importances
                    function to see which columns were good. Based on the result, these columns were highly correlated
                    with the number of offers, "RATE_USD", "PALLETIZED_LINEAR_FEET",
                    "APPROXIMATE_DRIVING_ROUTE_MILEAGE", 'POP2012_ORIGIN', "x_ORIGIN", "y_ORIGIN",
                    'LOAD_DELIVERED_FROM_OFFER', 'OFFER_TYPE', 'STATE_ORIGIN', 'STATE_DESTINATION',
                    "POP2012_DESTINATION", "WEEKDAY_NUM", thus we started building the model just using these columns.
                    And we applied GridSearch method to it.</p>

                <p>Then, we build an ensemble model that consists of two sub-models, one for each offer type – each
                    model predicts the expected offer rate for each delivery type. The first sub-model is a simple
                    linear regression model that is responsible for predicting the estimated cost of delivering an FTL
                    shipment. The second model is more complicated in that it not only predicts the estimated cost of
                    delivering a PTL shipment but also utilizes logistic regression to predict the probability of a
                    given item actually being pooled. That is, the second sub-model takes into account the fact that
                    delivery items often have a lower chance of being pooled as their shipment deadlines approach. By
                    incorporating this knowledge, the sub-model appreciates PTL offers more as the delivery deadline
                    nears. Put together, these two sub-models can gauge the significance of each offer that is made to
                    an order, enabling Flock Freight to make the decision to either take or reject the offer.</p>
