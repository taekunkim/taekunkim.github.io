One of the roles of a Data Scientist is to relay new findings to stakeholders. Sometimes, however, it is easier to let stakeholders interact with the data instead of verbally communicating, as it gives them the time to comfortably go over the data without feeling rushed.

Visualizations like these can be sent to a mass of people to share in-depth analyses.

Below is a demo of a brief interactable visualization of flight delays at San Diego International Airport (SAN). The visualizations were created using <b>Javascript</b> and <b>D3.js</b>.
